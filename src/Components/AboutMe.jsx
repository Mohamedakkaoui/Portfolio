              Heyyyy-yo! Akkaoui here, I hold a bachelor's degree in Physics and
              recently graduated from a dynamic program called Arkx, where I
              specialized in Full Stack Development with a focus on the MERN
              stack. Before diving into the world of full-stack development, I
              honed my skills in Software Engineering at ALX. <br /> <br />{" "}
              Currently, I'm bringing my passion and expertise to 2peerfect as a
              Full Stack Developer intern. Coding is not just a job for meâ€”it's
              a source of joy and excitement. I love creating, learning, and
              exploring new technologies and methodologies that push the
              boundaries of what's possible.. <br /> <br /> Beyond the screen,
              I'm an avid reader who finds inspiration in books, and I love the
              challenge and teamwork involved in playing basketball. These
              interests keep me balanced and fueled with fresh ideas and
              perspectives. <br /> <br /> I'm always eager to take on new
              challenges, contribute to exciting projects, and make things
              better. If you're looking for someone who combines technical
              prowess with a passion for continuous learning and personal
              growth, let's connect!
